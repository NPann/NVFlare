Install NVFlare in virtual environments
---------------------------------------

It is highly recommended to install NVFlare in a virtual environment.
This guide briefly describes how to create a virtual environment with venv.


Virtual Environments and Packages 
.................................

Python's official document explains the main idea about virtual environments.
The module used to create and manage virtual environments is called `venv <https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/venv.html#module-venv>`_.
You can find more information there.  We only describe a few necessary steps for a virtual environment for NVFlare.


Depending on your OS and the Python distribution, you may need to install the Python's venv package separately.  For example, in ubuntu
20.04, you need to run the following commands to continue creating a virtual environment with venv.

.. code-block:: shell

   $ sudo apt update
   $ sudo apt-get install python3-venv


Once venv is installed, you can use it to create a virtual environment with:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ python3 -m venv nvflare-env

This will create the ``nvflare-env`` directory in current working directory if it doesnâ€™t exist,
and also create directories inside it containing a copy of the Python interpreter,
the standard library, and various supporting files.


Activate the virtualenv by running the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ source nvflare-env/bin/activate


You may find that the pip and setuptools versions in the venv need updating:

.. code-block:: shell

  (nvflare-env) $ python3 -m pip install -U pip
  (nvflare-env) $ python3 -m pip install -U setuptools



Install Stable Release
----------------------

    
Stable releases are available on `PyPI NVFlare <https://pypi.org/project/nvflare>`_::

  $ python3 -m pip install nvflare

    

Install Nightly Release
-----------------------

NVFlare also has nightly build at `NVFlare night build <https://pypi.org/project/nvflare-nightly/>`_.
You can install the package with the following command::

  $ python3 -m pip install nvflare-nightly
