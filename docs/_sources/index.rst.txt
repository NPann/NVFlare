Nvidia Federated Learning Application Runtime Environment (NVFlare) is a extensible federated learning framework.
You can bring existing machine learning tasks into a federated setting easily.
Moreover, NVFlare is built on a componentized architecture, which allows the researchers to experiment with
different ideas of FL quickly.

Federated learning allows for multiple clients each with their own data to collaborate on training together without
having to share their actual data. This allows for different parties located any place in the world to use their local
secure protected data to perform learning tasks while the FL server set up in the secure cloud can coordinate and
exchange results to achieve better learning results.
